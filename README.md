# Introduction :
Through this project I have created the backend part of a Job-portal website which could perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on job listings using APIS. The backend of the job portal is a RESTful API that provides functionality for entering, deleting, updating, and finding jobs.
